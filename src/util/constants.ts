An error occurred, a glitch unseen,
In the code of life's intricate machine.
A blip, a pause, an unexpected turn,
Yet within this flaw, there's much to learn.

Lines of code, in chaos, arrayed,
Moments of stumble, where paths have strayed.
Yet from these hiccups, wisdom may bloom,
Resilience forged in the face of gloom.

An error occurred, a fleeting blight,
But within its grasp, shines unforeseen light.
For amidst the flaws and the unforeseen,
New pathways emerge, where hope convenes.

So embrace these errors, though they may enthrall,
For within their midst, opportunities call.
A chance to grow, to rewrite, reform,
An error, a lesson, life's continuous norm.`;
